The question: Can Deep Learning Transformers Model Reddit’s WallStreetBets to Analyse Financial Advice?

This study investigates the movements in the stock market in early 2021 as a result of online financial
investment communities’ behaviour. Community post semantic analysis is performed via the use of deep
learning transformers, RoBERTa, a large language model and word vectorisation with word2vec. Focusing on
the unique dynamics of the WallStreetBets community on Reddit, our methodology involves preprocessing
social media data and employing state-of-the-art deep learning transformers for classification and predictive
modelling. This research has value in being able to offer insights into potential correlations between retail
trader collaborative behaviours having large and valuable implications on the stock market.
