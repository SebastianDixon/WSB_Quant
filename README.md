The question: WallStreetBets: The Future of Retail Trading, are Hedge Funds at Risk?

The market events of the January 2021 GameStop short squeeze led by Reddit’s WallStreetBets started discussion by institutional investors to reevaluate the retail investor effect on the market. Previous to this event, retail investors were thought to have little influence on stock market value. This assumption then justified by Wall Street trading teams with greater accuracy and access to more privileged data. This paper researches the statistical relationship between WallStreetBets and the equity stock market in an effort to determine the quality of the financial advice. By using a dataset with posts from 2012 to 2021 we can investigate this relationship using both an empirical analysis of the investors proposed portfolio, and a machine learning random forest classification model. The portfolio is composed of the top 16 most mentioned traded equities and ETFs in the dataset. The features in this model consist of sentiment values for post’s titles, portfolio Boolean quantities, and the posts score. The sentiment is composed using VADER with a custom vocabulary. The portfolio in conjunction with our trading strategy generates a 950% return over the 9-years outperforming the S&P 500. Our classification model outputs 76% accuracy in calculating if the stock price will increase or not in a weeks’ time. These results confirm there is a relationship between the posts and stock market value. Further labelling posts as proactive financial advice. In addition to the portfolio outperforming the S&P index, hedge funds should consider online retail investors to be more than noise in the market.
